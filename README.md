# Prefixes and Suffixes
A group of Python codes that, given a set of words, create new words by adding or removing prefixes and suffixes.
1. Add a prefix to a word. This function takes a word as parameter and adds the prefix "un" at the front of the word.
2. Add prefixes to word groups. This function takes a list of words including a prefix and other words. Then it adds the prefix to each of the other words.
3. Remove a suffix from a word. This function takes a word with the suffix "ness" and return the root word by removing the suffix. When necessary, it also replce the last letter "i" with the letter "y".
